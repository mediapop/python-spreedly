A python API for the spreedly subscription service.
===================================================

This is an api wrapper for [spreedly](http://spreedly.com).  It is not complete, and is primarily used as a backend for [django-spreedly](http://github.com/mediapop/django-spreedly).

It is intended to be turned into a general python api that is usable for any project.

Todo:
=====

* add support for sending a user to spreedly to sign up for a subscription
* add support for checking if a subscription for a user has been activated
* update these docs

Please report all issues to our git hub [issue tracker](https://github.com/mediapop/python-spreedly/issues)
